# GUI
These are the GUI I developed using Python Tkinter, CustomTkinter, and other tools!

## **Calculator**:

This is a demo video of the calculator GUI I created using CustomTkinter. It has many functions of a regular calculator and it has a working night/light mode users can toggle. This calculator GUI is also dynamically resizable, meaning that when the user modifies the size of the calculator window, all of the calculator's widgets will change appropriately to fit the new window size.

## **Image Viewer**:

These demo videos are of the Image Viewer GUI I created using CustomTkinter. This was the hardest and most complicated computer program I have ever built so far, numbering around 1300 lines of code. This project took me about two months to complete and I am very proud of it. 

I tried to emulate the functions of the built-in image viewer of the Windows OS. This program allows users to open images from the file dialogue, delete images, rotate images, make images full screen, exit full screen using the "ESC" key, zoom in on the image, zoom out on the image, use the up and down arrow keys to move through the images in a folder.  

This project tested all the programming concepts and computer science logic I have learned so far and pushed me to my limits as a developer. I also learned many new things from working on this project such as debugging effectively and using every possible tool (such as ChatGPT and Stack Overflow) to solve problems or create new solutions. 

Furthermore, I also found the beauty of using object-orientated programming to organize code. I didn't use OOP in my calculator GUI because, frankly, I was intimidated by it, but after using it to organize my code for this image viewer, I now understand why it is the standard for well-made industry code. OOP is easier to manage and makes your program understandable. In my image viewer folder, you can see the difference between my pre-OOP code and my post-OOP code. The difference is clear as night as day. 

While my code did improve significantly when I changed to OOP, there are still bugs in my program that I, unfortunately, cannot fix no matter how hard I try. Thus, I have decided to move on to other projects to improve my coding skills further. Nevertheless, this project was an amazing, yet rigorous, experience and I can't wait to use the things I've learned from this to tackle more projects and real-world scenarios.
