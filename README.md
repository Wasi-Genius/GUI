# GUI
These are the GUI I developed using Python Tkinter, CustomTkinter, and other tools!

## **Calculator**:

This is a demo video of the calculator GUI I created using CustomTkinter. It has many functions of a regular calculator and it has a working night/light mode users can toggle. This calculator GUI is also dynamically resizable, meaning that when the user modifies the size of the calculator window, all of the calculator's widgets will change appropriately to fit the new window size.
